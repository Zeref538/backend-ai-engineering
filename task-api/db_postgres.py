"""The same storage interface as db.py, backed by PostgreSQL instead of SQLite.

This is the third storage engine behind identical routes: a Python list, then a
file, now a database server in a container. main.py imports whichever module
matches the environment and calls the same seven functions. Nothing in the API
layer knows the difference -- that is the whole point of keeping SQL in one file.

Two differences from the SQLite version worth knowing:
  - placeholders are %s, not ?
  - Postgres has a real boolean, so no 0/1 translation is needed
